Launch SoniFight_x86.bat for games which are 32-bit processes or SoniFight_x64.bat for games which are 64-bit processes.

Then pick a config for your game, click the run selected config button and then launch your game.

If you don't have executables in the bin folder you may have downloaded the source code instead of the pre-compiled package by accident.

Pre-compiled releases are available from: https://github.com/FedUni/SoniFight/releases
